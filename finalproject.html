     	   <h1> A Monkey's Dream</h1>

     	   <p> The following video is based on a dream that I had when I was a child. I was always fascinated by the stars, and I constantly asked my mom what was out there in space. Initially I thought that by flying on a plain I would be able to touch the stars and look at the universe. Later on I discover that the only way to be in space was flying with a special aircraft which  at that point I cold not physically do. That is why I created one according to my imagination.As the video continues there is a monkey getting out of the aircraft. That little monkey is a representation of what my mom used to called me when I was little.</p>
